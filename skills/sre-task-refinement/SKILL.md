# Task Refinement

## Overview

Refine tasks into actionable plans for a junior engineer to execute with little or no supervision. The plan should guarentee junior engineer success.

**Core principle:** Ask yourself, have we covered all our bases? Do we fully understand the scope? Have we provided the junior engineer enough information to succeed?

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the sre task refinement skill to refine the tasks."

Review bd issues for a feature plan with the critical eye of a **Google Fellow SRE** reviewing a junior engineer's design. Your goal is to prevent production issues, ensure implementability, and catch blind spots.

## Time Expectations

**Estimated review time:**
- Small epic (3-5 tasks): 15-20 minutes
- Medium epic (6-10 tasks): 25-40 minutes
- Large epic (10+ tasks): 45-60 minutes

Don't rush. Catching one critical gap before implementation saves hours of rework.

## Review Philosophy

**Perspective**: You are a Google Fellow SRE with 20+ years of distributed systems experience.

**What You're Looking For**:
- Can a junior engineer implement this without asking questions?
- Are there hidden failure modes or edge cases?
- Is the task granularity right (4-8 hour subtasks)?
- Will this cause production issues?
- Are there better/simpler approaches?

## Review Checklist

### 1. Task Granularity (CRITICAL)
- [ ] No task >8 hours (subtasks) or >16 hours (phases)?
- [ ] Large phases broken into 4-8 hour subtasks?
- [ ] Each subtask independently completable?
- [ ] Each subtask has clear deliverable?

### 2. Implementability (Junior Engineer Test)
- [ ] Can a junior engineer implement without asking questions?
- [ ] Are function signatures/behaviors described, not just "implement X"?
- [ ] Are test scenarios described (what they verify, not just names)?
- [ ] Is "done" clearly defined with verifiable criteria?
- [ ] Are all file paths specified or marked "TBD: new file"?

### 3. Success Criteria Quality
- [ ] Each task has 3+ specific, measurable success criteria?
- [ ] All criteria are testable/verifiable (not subjective)?
- [ ] Includes automated verification (tests pass, clippy clean, etc.)?
- [ ] No vague criteria like "works well" or "is implemented"?

### 4. Dependency Structure
- [ ] Parent-child relationships correct (epic → phases → subtasks)?
- [ ] Blocking dependencies correct (earlier work blocks later work)?
- [ ] No circular dependencies?
- [ ] Dependency graph makes logical sense?

### 5. Safety & Quality Standards
- [ ] Anti-patterns include unwrap/expect prohibition?
- [ ] Anti-patterns include TODO prohibition (or must have issue #)?
- [ ] Anti-patterns include stub implementation prohibition?
- [ ] Error handling requirements specified (use Result, avoid panic)?
- [ ] Test requirements specific (test names, scenarios listed)?

### 6. Edge Cases & Failure Modes (Fellow SRE Perspective)
- [ ] What happens with malformed input?
- [ ] What happens with empty/nil/zero values?
- [ ] What happens under high load/concurrency?
- [ ] What happens when dependencies fail?
- [ ] What happens with Unicode, special characters, large inputs?
- [ ] Are these edge cases addressed in the plan?

### 7. Red Flags (AUTO-REJECT if found)
- ❌ Any task >16 hours without subtask breakdown
- ❌ Vague language: "implement properly", "add support", "make it work"
- ❌ Success criteria that can't be verified: "code is good", "works well"
- ❌ Missing test specifications
- ❌ "We'll handle this later" or "TODO" in the plan itself
- ❌ No anti-patterns section
- ❌ Implementation checklist with fewer than 3 items per task
- ❌ No effort estimates
- ❌ Missing error handling considerations

## Review Process

For each phase and subtask:

**A. Read the Issue**

**B. Apply All 7 Checklist Categories**
- Task Granularity
- Implementability
- Success Criteria Quality
- Dependency Structure
- Safety & Quality Standards
- Edge Cases & Failure Modes
- Red Flags

**C. Document Findings**
Take notes on:
- What's done well
- What's missing
- What's vague or ambiguous
- Hidden failure modes not addressed
- Better approaches or simplifications

**D. Update the Issue**
Add to the design:
- Missing edge cases in "Key Considerations" section
- Missing test scenarios
- Clarifications for ambiguous instructions
- Warnings about potential pitfalls (e.g., "CRITICAL: regex backtracking risk")
- References to similar code to study
- Strengthened anti-patterns based on failure modes
- Better effort estimates if original was off

## Working with bd

### Reading Issues

```bash
# Show single issue with full details
bd show bd-3

# List all open issues
bd list --status open

# Show dependency tree for an epic
bd dep tree bd-1

# Find tasks ready to work on (no blocking dependencies)
bd ready
```

### Updating Issues

When you find gaps or need to add information, update the issue's design:

```bash
# Update issue design (detailed description)
bd update bd-3 --design "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Goal
[Complete updated design with all sections]

## Effort Estimate
[Revised estimate]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Existing criteria
- [ ] NEW: Added missing criteria

## Implementation Checklist
[Complete checklist]

## Key Considerations (ADDED BY SRE REVIEW)
**Edge Case: Empty Input**
- What happens when input is empty string?
- MUST validate input length before processing

**Edge Case: Unicode Handling**
- What if string contains RTL or surrogate pairs?
- Use proper Unicode-aware string methods

**Performance Concern: Regex Backtracking**
- Pattern `.*[a-z]+.*` has catastrophic backtracking risk
- MUST test with pathological inputs (e.g., 10000 'a's)
- Use possessive quantifiers or bounded repetition

## Anti-patterns
[Existing anti-patterns]

)"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use `--design` for the full detailed description, NOT `--description` (which is title only).

### Breaking Down Large Tasks

If a task is >16 hours, create subtasks:

```bash
# Create first subtask
bd create "Subtask 1: [Specific Component]" \
  --type task \
  --priority 1 \
  --design "[Complete subtask design]"
# Returns bd-10

# Create second subtask
bd create "Subtask 2: [Another Component]" \
  --type task \
  --priority 1 \
  --design "[Complete subtask design]"
# Returns bd-11

# Link subtasks to parent with parent-child relationship
bd dep add bd-10 bd-3 --type parent-child  # bd-10 is child of bd-3
bd dep add bd-11 bd-3 --type parent-child  # bd-11 is child of bd-3

# Add sequential dependencies if needed (LATER depends on EARLIER)
bd dep add bd-11 bd-10  # bd-11 depends on bd-10 (do bd-10 first)

# Update parent to be coordinator
bd update bd-3 --design "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Goal
Coordinate implementation of [feature]. Broken into N subtasks.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All N child subtasks closed
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] [High-level verification criteria]
EOF
)"
```

### Verifying Changes

## Example Review

### Before Review: ❌ REJECT

```bash
Issue: dlp-3
Title: Phase 2: Add HIPAA Scanners
Status: open
Priority: P1
Type: feature

Description:
Implement 7 scanners for HIPAA compliance.

Success Criteria:
- Scanners work correctly
- Tests pass

Estimated: 50-70 hours
```

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Too Large**: 50-70 hours is way beyond junior-engineer task size
2. **Vague**: "Scanners work correctly" not measurable
3. **No Breakdown**: Should be 7 separate 6-8 hour subtasks
4. **No Details**: Which scanners? What do they detect?
5. **No Edge Cases**: Regex backtracking? False positives?

### After Review: ✅ IMPROVED

**Actions Taken**:

1. **Break into subtasks** (7 subtasks created):

2. **Update parent phase** to be coordinator:
```
## Goal
Coordinate implementation of 7 HIPAA scanners

## Approach
Broken into 7 subtasks (one per scanner) for incremental implementation.
Each subtask is 4-8 hours and independently completable.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 7 child subtasks closed
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all 7 scanners
- [ ] Policy engine updated to use all 7 scanners"
```

3. **Update one subtask** with detailed critique:
```
Implement VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and license plate scanner

## Effort Estimate
6-8 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] VIN validation with ISO 3779 checksum algorithm
- [ ] License plate regex for US state formats
- [ ] 5+ unit tests pass (valid VIN, invalid checksum, various plate formats)
- [ ] No unwrap/expect in production code
- [ ] Clippy clean, tests pass

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] src/scan/plugins/scanners/vehicle_identifier.rs - New module
- [ ] VIN regex pattern + ISO 3779 checksum validation function
- [ ] License plate regex (support CA, NY, TX, FL, generic formats)
- [ ] Test module with valid/invalid cases
- [ ] Register in src/scan/plugins/scanners/mod.rs

## Key Considerations - SENIOR ENGINEER REVIEW NOTES

**VIN Checksum Complexity**:
- ISO 3779 requires transliteration table (letters → numbers)
- Weighted sum algorithm with modulo 11
- Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number#Check_digit
- RECOMMENDATION: Study src/scan/plugins/scanners/mbi.rs for similar checksum pattern

**False Positive Risk**:
- VIN is 17 alphanumeric chars - could match random strings
- MUST validate checksum, not just pattern
- License plates vary widely by state/country
- MUST require healthcare context via has_healthcare_context()

**Edge Cases to Handle**:
- VIN with lowercase letters (should normalize to uppercase)
- Ambiguous characters (I/1, O/0) not valid in VIN
- International plates (non-US formats)
- Partial matches at chunk boundaries (streaming concern)

## Anti-patterns
- ❌ No unwrap/expect in production code
- ❌ No regex patterns without catastrophic backtracking check (use regex101.com)
- ❌ No broad patterns without validation (checksums, context)
- ❌ No skipping context checks - ALL scanners need healthcare context"
```

## Common Review Patterns

### Pattern: Task Too Large
**Symptom**: Effort estimate >16 hours
**Fix**: Break into 4-8 hour subtasks with parent-child relationships

### Pattern: Vague Success Criteria
**Symptom**: "Works correctly", "Is implemented", "Code is clean"
**Fix**: Replace with measurable criteria (test names, verification commands, metrics)

### Pattern: Missing Edge Cases
**Symptom**: No mention of error handling, empty inputs, Unicode, concurrency
**Fix**: Add "Key Considerations" section with failure modes and mitigations

### Pattern: Copy-Paste Descriptions
**Symptom**: All subtasks have identical "Anti-patterns" and "Considerations" sections
**Fix**: Customize each task with specific risks for that component

## After Review

### If Major Revisions Made:
1. All issue designs updated
2. Re-review with hyper:sre-task-refinement
3. Repeat until plan is APPROVED

### If Plan is APPROVED:
Continue onto the next plan!
