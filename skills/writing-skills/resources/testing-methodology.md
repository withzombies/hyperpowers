## Testing All Skill Types

Different skill types need different test approaches:

### Discipline-Enforcing Skills (rules/requirements)

**Examples:** TDD, verification-before-completion, designing-before-coding

**Test with:**
- Academic questions: Do they understand the rules?
- Pressure scenarios: Do they comply under stress?
- Multiple pressures combined: time + sunk cost + exhaustion
- Identify rationalizations and add explicit counters

**Success criteria:** Agent follows rule under maximum pressure

### Technique Skills (how-to guides)

**Examples:** condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing, defensive-programming

**Test with:**
- Application scenarios: Can they apply the technique correctly?
- Variation scenarios: Do they handle edge cases?
- Missing information tests: Do instructions have gaps?

**Success criteria:** Agent successfully applies technique to new scenario

### Pattern Skills (mental models)

**Examples:** reducing-complexity, information-hiding concepts

**Test with:**
- Recognition scenarios: Do they recognize when pattern applies?
- Application scenarios: Can they use the mental model?
- Counter-examples: Do they know when NOT to apply?

**Success criteria:** Agent correctly identifies when/how to apply pattern

### Reference Skills (documentation/APIs)

**Examples:** API documentation, command references, library guides

**Test with:**
- Retrieval scenarios: Can they find the right information?
- Application scenarios: Can they use what they found correctly?
- Gap testing: Are common use cases covered?

**Success criteria:** Agent finds and correctly applies reference information

## Common Rationalizations for Skipping Testing

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Skill is obviously clear" | Clear to you ≠ clear to other agents. Test it. |
| "It's just a reference" | References can have gaps, unclear sections. Test retrieval. |
| "Testing is overkill" | Untested skills have issues. Always. 15 min testing saves hours. |
| "I'll test if problems emerge" | Problems = agents can't use skill. Test BEFORE deploying. |
| "Too tedious to test" | Testing is less tedious than debugging bad skill in production. |
| "I'm confident it's good" | Overconfidence guarantees issues. Test anyway. |
| "Academic review is enough" | Reading ≠ using. Test application scenarios. |
| "No time to test" | Deploying untested skill wastes more time fixing it later. |

**All of these mean: Test before deploying. No exceptions.**

## Bulletproofing Skills Against Rationalization

Skills that enforce discipline (like TDD) need to resist rationalization. Agents are smart and will find loopholes when under pressure.

**Psychology note:** Understanding WHY persuasion techniques work helps you apply them systematically. See persuasion-principles.md for research foundation (Cialdini, 2021; Meincke et al., 2025) on authority, commitment, scarcity, social proof, and unity principles.

### Close Every Loophole Explicitly

Don't just state the rule - forbid specific workarounds:

<Bad>
```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it.
```
</Bad>

<Good>
```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete
```
</Good>

### Address "Spirit vs Letter" Arguments

Add foundational principle early:

```markdown
**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**
```

This cuts off entire class of "I'm following the spirit" rationalizations.

### Build Rationalization Table

Capture rationalizations from baseline testing (see Testing section below). Every excuse agents make goes in the table:

```markdown
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Tests after achieve same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
```

### Create Red Flags List

Make it easy for agents to self-check when rationalizing:

```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "It's about spirit not ritual"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**
```

### Update CSO for Violation Symptoms

Add to description: symptoms of when you're ABOUT to violate the rule:

```yaml
description: use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code
```

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills

Follow the TDD cycle:

### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)

Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior:
- What choices did they make?
- What rationalizations did they use (verbatim)?
- Which pressures triggered violations?

This is "watch the test fail" - you must see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.

### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill

Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases.

Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.

### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes

Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.
