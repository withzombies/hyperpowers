## Key Improvements

### 1. Quick Reference Tables
Every skill now has an at-a-glance table showing:
- Steps or categories
- Key actions
- Critical rules or outputs
- Enables rapid understanding without reading full skill

**Example (test-driven-development):**
```markdown
| Phase | Action | Output | Gate |
|-------|--------|--------|------|
| RED | Write failing test | Test fails ❌ | Confirms test actually tests |
| GREEN | Minimal code to pass | Test passes ✅ | Feature works |
| REFACTOR | Clean up with tests green | Tests still pass ✅ | Quality maintained |
```

### 2. Rigidity Levels
Explicit guidance on how strictly to follow each skill:
- **LOW FREEDOM:** Follow exactly (TDD, verification, review)
- **MEDIUM FREEDOM:** Adapt techniques, keep principles (hooks, debugging)
- **HIGH FREEDOM:** Adapt principles to context (naming, architecture)

### 3. Concrete Examples
Every skill has 2-3 real examples with:
- **scenario:** Common failure pattern
- **code:** What developer does wrong
- **why_it_fails:** Root cause analysis (5-7 specific reasons)
- **correction:** Complete correct approach with code
- **what_you_gain:** Benefits (5-7 specific improvements)

### 4. Critical Rules Sections
Two parts:
- **Rules That Have No Exceptions:** Non-negotiable principles
- **Common Excuses:** Rationalizations that signal you're about to fail

### 5. Verification Checklists
Concrete checkboxes for completion:
```markdown
Before completing:
- [ ] Specific verification step 1
- [ ] Specific verification step 2
- [ ] ...

**Can't check all boxes?** Return to process and complete.
```

### 6. Integration Sections
Shows how each skill fits in workflows:
- What skills call this one
- What skills this one calls
- Call chain diagrams
- Related skills

## Example Patterns

### Example Structure (Every Skill)
```xml
<example>
<scenario>Developer [does common mistake]</scenario>

<code>
[Complete code showing the mistake]
</code>

<why_it_fails>
- [Reason 1: specific problem]
- [Reason 2: specific problem]
- [Reason 3: cascading effect]
- [Reason 4: production impact]
- [Reason 5: why skill would prevent this]
</why_it_fails>

<correction>
[Complete correct approach with code and explanation]

**What you gain:**
- [Benefit 1: problem prevented]
- [Benefit 2: quality improvement]
- [Benefit 3: workflow efficiency]
- [Benefit 4: professional standard]
- [Benefit 5: long-term maintainability]
</correction>
</example>
```

### Example Topics Covered
1. **Skipping steps** (most common - every workflow skill)
2. **Assuming without verifying** (verification, review, refinement skills)
3. **Accepting vague specifications** (planning, refinement skills)
4. **Ignoring edge cases** (refinement, testing, debugging skills)
5. **Rationalizing shortcuts** (TDD, verification, quality skills)
6. **Working sequentially instead of parallel** (parallel agents)
7. **No conflict checking** (parallel agents)
8. **Placeholder text** (refinement, planning skills)

---

## Critical Rules Patterns

Every skill has:

### Rules That Have No Exceptions
Format: `**[Action]** → [Consequence/Requirement]`

Examples:
- **Write test first** → No code without failing test (TDD)
- **Run verification commands** → Evidence before claims (verification)
- **Apply all 7 categories** → No skipping any category (refinement)
- **Read actual files** → Not just git diff (review)
- **Trace to source** → Not just symptom (root-cause-tracing)

### Common Excuses
Format: `"[Excuse]" ([Reality check])`

Examples:
- "Tests pass, must be complete" (Tests ≠ spec, check all criteria)
- "Task looks straightforward" (Edge cases hide in "straightforward" tasks)
- "Just 2 failures, can still parallelize" (Overhead exceeds benefit)
- "Can handle edge cases during implementation" (Must specify upfront)
- "Hook is simple, don't need testing" (Untested hooks fail in production)

---

## Integration Patterns

Every skill documents:

### Call Chain Position
Example (executing-plans):
```
hyperpowers:brainstorming
    ↓
hyperpowers:writing-plans
    ↓
hyperpowers:sre-task-refinement
    ↓
hyperpowers:executing-plans (YOU ARE HERE)
    ↓
hyperpowers:review-implementation
    ↓
hyperpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
```

### Skills Called
- Direct invocations via Skill tool
- Agent dispatches
- Tool usage (bd, git, test-runner)

### Skills That Call This
- Upstream workflow steps
- Conditional branches

---

## Verification Checklist Patterns

Every skill has concrete, actionable checklists:

### Per-Step Verification
```markdown
**Step 1:**
- [ ] Specific action completed
- [ ] Specific output verified
- [ ] Specific gate condition met

**Step 2:**
- [ ] ...
```

### Overall Verification
```markdown
**Before completing:**
- [ ] All steps done (no skipped)
- [ ] All verification commands run
- [ ] All evidence captured
- [ ] All quality gates passed

**Can't check all boxes?** Return to process and complete.
```

---

## Common Patterns Files

Reference documents (no XML needed - already well-structured):

1. **bd-commands.md** (142 lines)
   - Reading, creating, updating, status, dependencies
   - Common mistakes and corrections
   - Valid status values

2. **common-anti-patterns.md** (94 lines)
   - Prohibited patterns across languages
   - Why they're prohibited
   - How to detect them

3. **common-rationalizations.md** (155 lines)
   - Excuses that signal failure
   - Reality checks
   - Referenced by multiple skills

---

## Before/After Comparison

### Example: test-driven-development

**Before (473 lines):**
```markdown
# Test-Driven Development

Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

[Rest of content...]
```

**After (614 lines):**
```xml
<skill_overview>
Write failing test first (RED), write minimal code to pass (GREEN), clean up (REFACTOR);
repeat for every feature, no exceptions.
</skill_overview>

<rigidity_level>
LOW FREEDOM - Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle exactly. Iron Law: NO CODE WITHOUT TEST FIRST.
</rigidity_level>

<quick_reference>
| Phase | Action | Output | Gate |
|-------|--------|--------|------|
| RED | Write failing test | Test fails ❌ | Confirms test actually tests |
| GREEN | Minimal code to pass | Test passes ✅ | Feature works |
| REFACTOR | Clean up | Tests still pass ✅ | Quality maintained |
